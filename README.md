## 1. Overview of the School District Analysis:
As we have been analyzing the data set of students_complete.csv for variables such as reading score, math score, passing math percentage, etc, we have now been informed that the school board has detected academic dishonesty in regard to reading and math grades being altered at Thomas High School. This academic dishonesty has occured amongst the 9th grade class, and consequently, the school board requests our analysis to see the full extent of this academic dishonesty. Our first order of business will be to replace the math and reading scores with NaNs, while at the same time keeping the rest of the data intact. Upon doing this, we wil then repeat the analyis of this module and then proceed to write a report that outlines how each change had an influence upon our overall analysis. 

## 2. Results:
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type
